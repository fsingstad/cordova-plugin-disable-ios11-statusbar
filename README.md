# cordova-plugin-disable-ios11-statusbar
Plugin to disable the iOS 11 statusbar

# Install
`cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-disable-ios11-statusbar`

That's it, you don't have to do anything else

# Deprecation notice
Since iOS 11 Beta 4 you can add this to your viewport meta tag to disable the fake statusbar, so the plugin is no longer needed
`viewport-fit=cover`
